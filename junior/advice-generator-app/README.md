## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript Fetch

### What I learned

- **Creating animations with box shadows in CSS:** You have learned how to use properties like box-shadow to create visual effects and animations in your HTML elements.

- **Getting data from an API in JSON format:** You have learned how to make requests to a public API and get data in JSON format using the fetch function.

- **DOM Management:** You have strengthened your understanding of how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate HTML elements, such as displaying or modifying data dynamically on a web page.

- **Creating functions:** You have created several functions in JavaScript to perform various tasks, such as creating objects, displaying information, searching for data, and managing forms.

- **Promises in JavaScript:** You have worked with promises in JavaScript, which allows you to handle asynchronous requests in a more orderly and structured way.

- **Error Handling:** You've added the ability to handle errors in your API requests using the .catch() method, which improves the robustness of your applications by anticipating and managing potential problems.
